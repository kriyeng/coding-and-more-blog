# The Blog

As a coder for more than 15 years I think it's time to start overcoming my impostor syndrome! This is the first reason to start this journey.

I know, there're infinite blogs, webs and every kind of stuff related to coding topics. I'll write this in the first place for myself. I read a lot of articles and opinions and I never find myself reflected in those points of view completely.
Otherwise, I'm trying to improve and strengthen my programming knowledge and I always listened that the best way to know what you really know is to try to teach and write about these concepts.

This is what I'll try to do from now on. Every advice will be welcome!
